## Aim
To build a classification model which tries to predict the label of the given input data. The classification model predicts the label of the Fashion Items. 
## Data
It is a dataset comprised of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of items of 10 types of clothing, such as shoes, t-shirts, dresses, and more. The mapping of all 0-9 integers to class labels is listed below.

0: T-shirt/top
1: Trouser
2: Pullover
3: Dress
4: Coat
5: Sandal
6: Shirt
7: Sneaker
8: Bag
9: Ankle boot

## Methodology
## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
One of the interesting ways at which we can use CNNs is that we might identify the Fashion Items. As a result, it is possible to estimate the density of wheat plants in different locations of the fields. This leads to a good understanding of the field quality. If the condition is poor, appropriate steps could be taken to ensure that wheat plants get adequate supply of nutrients which leads to their high quality production.

It is also important to accurately detect the wheat plants and sometimes the wind could blur the images. In addition to this, there could be factors such as maturity, color, genotype, and head orientation that could make detecting and classifying weed a challenging task.
